### Welcome to my C++ Snippets repository!

This repository was created to document my current understanding of C++. It serves as a personal collection of code snippets and may not always represent best practices. Over time, it will evolve as a reflection of my progress. The primary focus of this repository is on data structures, algorithms, and related areas.
